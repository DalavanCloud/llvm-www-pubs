<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
We investigate to which extent data partitioning can help improve the performance of
software transactional memory (STM). Our main idea is that the access patterns of the
various data structures of an application might be sufficiently different so that it would
be beneficial to tune the behavior of the STM for individual data partitions. We evaluate
our approach using standard transactional memory benchmarks. We show that these
applications contain partitions with different characteristics and, despite the runtime
overhead introduced by partition tracking and dynamic tuning, that partitioning provides
significant performance improvements.
