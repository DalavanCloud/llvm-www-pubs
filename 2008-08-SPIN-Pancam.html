<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
A key challenge in model checking software is the difficulty 
of verifying properties of implementation code, as opposed to checking an 
abstract algorithmic description. We describe a tool for verifying 
multithreaded C programs that uses the SPIN model checker. Our tool works 
by compiling a multi-threaded C program into a typed bytecode format, 
and then using a virtual machine that interprets the bytecode and 
computes new program states under the direction of SPIN. Our virtual 
machine is compatible with most of SPIN's search options and optimization 
flags, such as bitstate hashing and multi-core checking. It provides 
support for dynamic memory allocation (the malloc and free family of 
functions), and for the pthread library, which provides primitives often 
used by multi-threaded C programs. A feature of our approach is that it 
can check code after compiler optimizations, which can sometimes introduce 
race conditions. We describe how our tool addresses the state space 
explosion problem by allowing users to define data abstraction functions 
and to constrain the number of allowed context switches. We also describe 
a reduction method that reduces context switches using dynamic 
knowledge computed on-the-fly, while being sound for both safety and 
liveness properties. Finally, we present initial experimental results with 
our tool on some small examples.
