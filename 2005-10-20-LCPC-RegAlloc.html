<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>Techniques for global register allocation via graph coloring have 
been extensively studied and widely implemented in compiler frameworks. This 
paper examines a particular variant - the Callahan Koblenz allocator - and 
compares it to the Chaitin-Briggs graph coloring register allocator. Both al- 
gorithms were published in the 1990's, yet the academic literature does not 
contain an assessment of the Callahan-Koblenz allocator. This paper evaluates 
and contrasts the allocation decisions made by both algorithms. In particular, 
we focus on two key differences between the allocators: 
<b>Spill code</b>: The Callahan-Koblenz allocator attempts to minimize the effect of 
spill code by using program structure to guide allocation and spill code place- 
ment. We evaluate the impact of this strategy on allocated code. 
<b>Copy elimination</b>: Effective register-to-register copy removal is important for 
producing good code. The allocators use different techniques to eliminate these 
copies. We compare the mechanisms and provide insights into the relative per- 
formance of the contrasting techniques. 
The Callahan-Koblenz allocator may potentially insert extra branches as part 
of the allocation process. We also measure the performance overhead due to 
these branches.
