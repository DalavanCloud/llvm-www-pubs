<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Cross-procedure tracing implies finding frequently executing paths in a
program that span
one or more procedures. A runtime optimizer detects such paths and optimizes
them to
improve overall program performance. Even though several instrumentation
techniques exist
for tracing programs offline, most have high overheads which makes them unsuitable
for
runtime optimization. In this work we present a lightweight technique to
detect cross-
procedure traces at runtime.
