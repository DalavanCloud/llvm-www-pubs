<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
This paper describes an efficient and robust
approach to provide a <i>safe execution environment</i> for an entire
operating system, such as Linux, and all its applications.  The
approach, which we call <i>Secure Virtual Architecture</i> (SVA),
defines a virtual, low-level, typed instruction set suitable for
executing <i>all</i> code on a system, including kernel and
application code.  SVA code is translated for execution by a virtual
machine transparently, offline or online.
SVA aims to enforce <i>fine-grained (object level) memory safety</i>,
<i>control-flow integrity</i>,
<i>type safety for a subset of objects</i>, and <i>sound analysis</i>.
A virtual machine implementing SVA achieves these goals by using a
novel approach that exploits properties of existing memory pools in
the kernel and by preserving the kernel's explicit control over
memory, including custom allocators and explicit deallocation.
Furthermore, the safety properties can be encoded compactly as
extensions to the SVA type system,
allowing the (complex) safety checking compiler to be outside
the trusted computing base.  SVA also defines a set of OS interface
operations that abstract all privileged hardware instructions,
allowing the virtual machine to monitor all privileged operations
and control the physical resources on a given hardware platform.
We have ported the Linux kernel to SVA, treating it as a new
architecture, and made only minimal code changes (less than 300 lines of code)
to the machine-independent parts of the kernel and device drivers.
SVA is able to prevent 4 out of 5 memory safety exploits previously reported
for the Linux 2.4.22 kernel for which exploit code is available, and would
prevent the fifth one simply by compiling an additional kernel library.
