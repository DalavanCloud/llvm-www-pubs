<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Performance estimation of processor is important to select the right processor for an application. Poorly chosen processors can either under perform very badly or over 
perform but with high cost. Most previous work on performance estimation are based on generating the development tools, i.e., compilers, assemblers etc from a processor 
description file and then additionally generating an instruction set simulator to get the performance. In this work we 
present a simpler strategy for performance estimation. We 
propose an estimation technique based on the intermediate format of an application. The estimation process does 
not require the generation of all the development tools as in 
the prevalent methods. As a result our method is not only 
cheaper but also faster.
