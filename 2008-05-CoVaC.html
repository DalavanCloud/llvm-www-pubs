<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
The paper presents a deductive framework for proving program equivalence 
and its application to automatic verification of transformations performed
by optimizing compilers. To leverage existing program analysis techniques,
 we reduce the equivalence checking problem to 
analysis of one system - a cross-product of the two input programs. We 
show how the approach can be effectively used for checking equivalence of 
consonant (i.e., structurally similar) programs. Finally, we report on the 
prototype tool that applies the developed methodology to verify that a 
compiler optimization run preserves the program semantics. Unlike existing 
frameworks, CoVaC accommodates absence of compiler annotations 
and handles most of the classical intraprocedural optimizations such as 
constant folding, reassociation, common subexpression elimination, code 
motion, dead code elimination, branch optimizations, and others.
