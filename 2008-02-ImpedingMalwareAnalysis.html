<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>

Malware programs that incorporate trigger-based behavior 
initiate malicious activities based on conditions satisfied 
only by specific inputs. State-of-the-art malware analyzers
discover code guarded by triggers via multiple path 
exploration, symbolic execution, or forced conditional execution, 
all without knowing the trigger inputs. We present 
a malware obfuscation technique that automatically conceals specific 
trigger-based behavior from these malware 
analyzers. Our technique automatically transforms a program 
by encrypting code that is conditionally dependent on an input 
value with a key derived from the input and then 
removing the key from the program. We have implemented 
a compiler-level tool that takes a malware source program 
and automatically generates an obfuscated binary. Experiments 
on various existing malware samples show that our 
tool can hide a signiÔ¨Åcant portion of trigger based code. We 
provide insight into the strengths, weaknesses, and possible 
ways to strengthen current analysis approaches in order to 
defeat this malware obfuscation technique.
