<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>As both programs and machines are becoming more complex, writing high
performance codes is an increasingly difficult task.  In order to bridge the gap
between the compiled-code and peak performance, resorting to domain or
architecture-specific libraries has become compulsory.  However, deciding when
and where to use a library function must be specified by the programmer.  This
partition between library and user code is not questioned by the compiler
although it has great impact on performance.  We propose in this paper a new
method that helps the user find in its application all code fragments that can 
be replaced with library calls.  The same technique can be used to change or
fusion multiple calls into more efficient ones.  The results of the alternative
detection of BLAS 1 and 2 in SPEC are presented.</p>
