<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
This paper describes <b>Automatic Pool Allocation</b>, a transformation
framework that segregates distinct instances of heap-based data structures
into seperate memory pools and allows heuristics to be used to
partially control the internal layout of those data structures.
The primary goal of this work is performance improvement, not automatic memory
management, and the paper makes several new contributions.  The key
contribution is a new compiler algorithm for partitioning heap objects in
imperative programs based on a context-sensitive pointer analysis, including a
novel strategy for correct handling of indirect (and potentially unsafe)
function calls.  The transformation does not require type safe programs and
works for the full generality of C and C++.  Second, the paper describes
several optimizations that exploit data structure partitioning to further
improve program performance.  Third, the paper evaluates how memory
hierarchy behavior and overall program performance are impacted by the new
transformations.  Using a number of benchmarks and a few applications, we find
that compilation times are extremely low, and overall running times for heap
intensive programs speed up by 10-25% in many cases, about 2x in two
cases, and more than 10x in two small benchmarks.  Overall, we believe this
work provides a new framework for optimizing pointer intensive programs by
segregating and controlling the layout of heap-based data structures.
