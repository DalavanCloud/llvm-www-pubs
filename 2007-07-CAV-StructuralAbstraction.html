<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Precise software analysis and verification require tracking the exact
path along which a statement is executed (path-sensitivity), the different contexts
from which a function is called (context-sensitivity), and the bit-accurate
operations performed. Previously, verification with such precision has been considered
too inefficient to scale to large software. In this paper, we present
a novel approach to solving such verification conditions, based on an automatic
abstraction-checking-refinement framework that exploits natural abstraction
boundaries present in software. Experimental results show that our approach
easily scales to over 200,000 lines of real C/C++ code.
