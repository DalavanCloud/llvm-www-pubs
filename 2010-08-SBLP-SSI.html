<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Static Single Information form (SSI) is a program
representation that enables optimizations such as array bound checking
elimination and conditional constant propagation. Transforming a program
into SSI form has a non-negligible impact on compilation time; but, only
a few SSI clients, that is, optimizations that use SSI, require a full
conversion. This paper describes the SSI framework we have implemented
for the LLVM compiler, and that is now part of this compiler's standard
distribution. In our design, optimizing passes inform the compiler a list
of variables of interest, which are then transformed to present, fully
or partially, the SSI properties. It is provided to each client only the
subset of SSI that the client needs. Our implementation orchestrates the
execution of clients in sequence, avoiding redundant work when two
clients request the conversion of the same variable. As empirically
demonstrated, in the context of an industrial strength compiler, our
approach saves compilation time and keeps the program representation
small, while enabling a vast array of code optimizations.
