<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Static analysis of programs in weakly typed languages such as C and C++ is
generally not sound because of possible memory errors due to dangling pointer
references, uninitialized pointers, and array bounds overflow. We describe a
compilation strategy for standard C programs that guarantees that aggressive
interprocedural pointer analysis (or less precise ones), a call graph, and type
information for a subset of memory, are never invalidated by any possible
memory errors. We formalize our approach as a new type system with the
necessary run-time checks in operational semantics and prove the correctness of
our approach for a subset of C. Our semantics provide the foundation for other
sophisticated static analyses to be applied to C programs with a guarantee of
soundness. Our work builds on a previously published transformation called
Automatic Pool Allocation to ensure that hard-to-detect memory errors (dangling
pointer references and certain array bounds errors) cannot invalidate the call
graph, points-to information or type information. The key insight behind our
approach is that pool allocation can be used to create a run-time partitioning
of memory that matches the compile-time memory partitioning in a points-to
graph, and efficient checks can be used to isolate the run-time partitions.
Furthermore, we show that the sound analysis information enables static
checking techniques that eliminate many run-time checks. Our approach requires
no source code changes, allows memory to be managedexplicitly, and does not use
meta-data on pointers or individual tag bits for memory. Using several
benchmark s and system codes, we show experimentally that the run-time
overheads are low (less than 10% in nearly all cases and 30% in the worst case
we have seen).We also show the effectiveness of static analyses in eliminating
run-time checks.
