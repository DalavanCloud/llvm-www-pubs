<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
As semiconductor technology scales into the deep 
submicron regime the occurrence of transient or soft errors will 
increase. This will require new approaches to error detection. 
Software checking approaches are attractive because they require 
little hardware modiﬁcation and can be easily adjusted to ﬁt different reliability and performance requirements. Unfortunately, 
software checking adds a signiﬁcant performance overhead. 
  
In this paper we present ESoftCheck, a set of compiler 
optimization techniques to determine which are the vital checks, 
that is, the minimum number of checks that are necessary to 
detect an error and roll back to a correct program state. ESoftCheck identiﬁes the vital checks on platforms where registers 
are hardware-protected with parity or ECC, when there are 
redundant checks and when checks appear in loops. ESoftCheck 
also provides knobs to trade reliability for performance based 
on the support for recovery and the degree of trustiness of the 
operations. Our experimental results on a Pentium 4 show that 
ESoftCheck can obtain 27.1% performance improvement without 
losing fault coverage.
