<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Random access memory (RAM) is tightly-constrained in many 
embedded systems. This is especially true for the least expensive, lowest-power embedded systems, such as sensor network 
nodes and portable consumer electronics. The most widely-used sensor network nodes have only 4-10 KB of RAM and 
do not contain memory management units (MMUs). It is very 
difficult to implement increasingly complex applications under 
such tight memory constraints. Nonetheless, price and power 
consumption constraints make it unlikely that increases in RAM 
in these systems will keep pace with the requirements of applications.<p>

We propose the use of automated compile-time and run-time 
techniques to increase the amount of usable memory in MMU-less embedded systems. The proposed techniques do not in- 
crease hardware cost, and are designed to require few or no 
changes to existing applications. We have developed a fast compression algorithm well suited to this application, as well as run-time library routines and compiler transformations to control 
and optimize the automatic migration of application data between compressed and uncompressed memory regions. These 
techniques were experimentally evaluated on Crossbow TelosB 
sensor network nodes running a number of data collection and 
signal processing applications. The results indicate that available memory can be increased by up to 50% with less than 10% 
performance degradation for most benchmarks.
