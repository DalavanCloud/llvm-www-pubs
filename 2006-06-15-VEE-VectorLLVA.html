<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
We present Vector LLVA, a virtual instruction set architecture (V-ISA)
that exposes extensive static information about vector parallelism
while avoiding the use of hardware-specific parameters.  We provide
both arbitrary-length vectors (for targets that allow vectors of
arbitrary length, or where the target length is not known) and
fixed-length vectors (for targets that have a fixed vector length,
such as subword SIMD extensions), together with a rich set of
operations on both vector types.  We have implemented translators that
compile (1) Vector LLVA written with arbitrary-length vectors to the
Motorola RSVP architecture and (2) Vector LLVA written with
fixed-length vectors to both AltiVec and Intel SSE2.  Our
translator-generated code achieves speedups competitive with
handwritten native code versions of several benchmarks on all three
architectures.  These experiments show that our V-ISA design captures
vector parallelism for two quite different classes of architectures
and provides virtual object code portability within the class of
subword SIMD architectures.
