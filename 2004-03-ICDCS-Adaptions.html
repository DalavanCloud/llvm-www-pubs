<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Distributed applications may use sophisticated run-time
adaptation strategies to meet their performance
or quality-of-service goals. Coordinating an adaptation
that involves multiple processes can require complex
communication or synchronization, in addition to communication
in the base application. We propose conceptually
simple high-level directives and a sophisticated runtime algorithm
for coordinating adaptation automatically and
transparently in distributed applications. The coordination
directives specify when to adapt, in terms of the relative
computational progress of each relevant process. The coordination
algorithm relies on simple compiler transformations
to track the progress of the processes, and performs
the adaptive changes locally and asynchronously at each
process. Measurements of the runtime overhead of the automatic
coordination algorithm for two adaptive applications
(a parallel PDE solver and a distributed video tracking
code) show that the overhead is less than 1% of execution
time for both these codes, even with relatively frequent
adaptations, and does not grow significantly with the number
of coordinating processes.
