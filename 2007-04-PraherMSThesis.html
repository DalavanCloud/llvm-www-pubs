<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
When developing or deploying large applications, one would like to have more insights 
into what an application is doing at runtime. Frequently it is required to change defective 
parts of an application as fast as possible. For instance one may wish to replace a certain 
function call in a program with another function call whenever a specified condition 
holds. This master thesis aims at building the change framework, a system for dynamic 
program instrumentation and analysis. This research builds atop of the Low Level Virtual 
Machine (LLVM) for representing C/C++ applications in an intermediate form. The 
change framework consists of two parts, the application under analysis, and a monitor 
process. The application under analysis is a C/C++ application compiled to LLVM 
bytecodes. The monitor process communicates with the application process and is able 
to dynamically instrument and analyze the application process using a domain specific 
language. This change language has powerful constructs for defining and conditionally 
applying application changes. An important overall goal of this system is to ease the 
analysis as well as alteration of low level system software at run-time.
