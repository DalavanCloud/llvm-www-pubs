<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
This paper presents an analysis technique and a novel program transformation
that can enable powerful optimizations for entire linked data structures.  The
fully automatic transformation converts ordinary programs to use pool (aka
region) allocation for heap-based data structures.  The transformation relies on
an efficient link-time interprocedural analysis to identify disjoint data
structures in the program, to check whether these data structures are accessed
in a type-safe manner, and to construct a Disjoint Data Structure Graph that
describes the connectivity pattern within such structures.  We present
preliminary experimental results showing that the data structure analysis and
pool allocation are effective for a set of pointer intensive programs in the
Olden benchmark suite.  To illustrate the optimizations that can be enabled by
these techniques, we describe a novel pointer compression transformation and
briefly discuss several other optimization possibilities for linked data
structures.
