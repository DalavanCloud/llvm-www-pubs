<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Instruction selection is a well-studied compiler phase that translates 
the compiler's intermediate representation of programs to a sequence 
of target-dependent machine instructions optimizing for 
various compiler objectives (e.g. speed and space). Most existing 
instruction selection techniques are limited to the scope of a single 
statement or a basic block and cannot cope with irregular instruction 
sets that are frequently found in embedded systems. </p>

<p> We consider an optimal technique for instruction selection that 
uses Static Single Assignment (SSA) graphs as an intermediate 
representation of programs and employs the Partitioned Boolean 
Quadratic Problem (PBQP) for Ô¨Ånding an optimal instruction selection. 
While existing approaches are limited to instruction patterns that 
can be expressed in a simple tree structure, we consider complex 
patterns producing multiple results at the same 
time including pre/post increment addressing modes, div-mod instructions, 
and SIMD extensions frequently found in embedded 
systems. Although both instruction selection on SSA-graphs and 
PBQP are known to be NP-complete, the problem can be solved 
efficiently - even for very large instances. </p>

<p>
Our approach has been implemented in LLVM for an embedded 
ARMv5 architecture. Extensive experiments show speedups of up 
to 57% on typical DSP kernels and up to 10% on SPECINT 2000 
and MiBench benchmarks. All of the test programs could be com- 
piled within less than half a minute using a heuristic PBQP solver 
that solves 99.83% of all instances optimally. </p>
