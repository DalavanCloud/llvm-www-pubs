<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
We describe a strategy for enabling existing commodity operating
systems to recover from unexpected run-time errors in nearly any part
of the kernel, including core kernel components.  Our approach is
dynamic and request-oriented, in the sense that it isolates the
effects of a fault to requests that cause a fault rather than to
static kernel components.  The approach is based on a notion of
``recovery domains,'' an organizing principle to enable partial
rollback of affected state within a request in a multithreaded system.
We have applied this approach to the Linux kernel and it required less
than 126 lines of changed or new code: the other changes are all
performed by a simple instrumentation pass of a compiler.  Our
experiments show that the approach is able to recover from otherwise
fatal faults with minimal collateral impact during a recovery event.
