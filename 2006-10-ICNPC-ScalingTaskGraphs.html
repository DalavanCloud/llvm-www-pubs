<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Modern network processors (NPs) are highly multithreaded chip multiprocessors (CMPs), supporting 
a wide variety of mechanisms for on-chip storage and inter-task communication. Real network processor 
applications are hard to program and must be tailored to fit the resources of the underlying NP, motivating 
an automated approach to mapping multithreaded applications to NPs. In this paper we propose and evaluate
compiler-based automated task and data management techniques to scale the throughput of network 
processing task graphs onto NPs. We evaluate these techniques using a NP simulation infrastructure based 
on realistic NP applications, and present an approach to discovering performance bottlenecks. Finally we 
demonstrate how our techniques enhance throughput-scaling for NPs.
