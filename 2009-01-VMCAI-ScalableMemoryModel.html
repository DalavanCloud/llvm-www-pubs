<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Because of its critical importance underlying all other software, low-level 
system software is among the most important targets for formal verification. 
Low-level systems software must sometimes make type-unsafe memory accesses, 
but because of the vast size of available heap memory in today's computer systems, 
faithfully representing each memory allocation and access does not scale 
when analyzing large programs. Instead, verification tools rely on abstract memory 
models to represent the program heap. This paper reports on two related 
investigations to develop an accurate (i.e., providing a useful level of soundness 
and precision) and scalable memory model: First, we compare a recently introduced 
memory model, specifically designed to more accurately model low-level 
memory accesses in systems code, to an older, widely adopted memory model. 
Unfortunately, we find that the newer memory model scales poorly compared to 
the earlier, less accurate model. Next, we investigate how to improve the 
soundness of the less accurate model. A direct approach is to add assertions to the code 
that each memory access does not break the assumptions of the memory model, 
but this causes verification complexity to blow-up. Instead, we develop a novel, 
extremely lightweight static analysis that quickly and conservatively guarantees 
that most memory accesses safely respect the assumptions of the memory model, 
thereby eliminating almost all of these extra type-checking assertions. Furthermore, 
this analysis allows us to create automatically memory models that flexibly 
use the more scalable memory model for most of memory, but resorting to a more 
accurate model for memory accesses that might need it.
