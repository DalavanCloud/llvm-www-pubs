<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Modern network processors (NPs) typically resemble a highly-multithreaded multiprocessor-on- 
a-chip, supporting a wide variety of mechanisms for on-chip storage and inter-task communication. 
NP applications are themselves composed of many threads that share memory and other resources, 
and synchronize and communicate frequently. In contrast, studies of new NP architectures and fea- 
tures are often performed by benchmarking a simulation model of the new NP using independent 
kernel programs that neither communicate nor share memory. In this paper we present a NP sim- 
ulation infrastructure that (i) uses realistic NP applications that are multithreaded, share memory, 
synchronize, and communicate; and (ii) automatically maps these applications to a variety of NP 
architectures and features. We use our infrastructure to evaluate threading and scaling, on-chip 
storage and communication, and to suggest future techniques for automated compilation for NPs.</p>
