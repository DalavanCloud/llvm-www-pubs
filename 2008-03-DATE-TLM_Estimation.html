<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
This paper presents a novel cycle-approximate performance estimation technique for automatically generated 
transaction level models (TLMs) for heterogeneous multicore designs. The inputs are application C processes and 
their mapping to processing units in the platform. The processing unit model consists of pipelined datapath, memory 
hierarchy and branch delay model. Using the processing 
unit model, the basic blocks in the C processes are analyzed 
and annotated with estimated delays. This is followed by 
a code generation phase where delay-annotated C code is 
generated and linked with a SystemC wrapper consisting of 
inter-process communication channels. The generated TLM 
is compiled and executed natively on the host machine. Our 
key contribution is that the estimation technique is close to 
cycle-accurate, it can be applied to any multi-core platform 
and it produces high-speed native compiled TLMs. For experiments, timed TLMs for industrial scale designs such as 
MP3 decoder were automatically generated for 4 heterogeneous multi-processor platforms with up to 5 PEs under 
1 minute. Each TLM simulated under 1 second, compared 
to 3-4 hrs of instruction set simulation (ISS) and 15-18 hrs 
of RTL simulation. Comparison to on-board measurement 
showed only 8% error on average in estimated number of 
cycles.
