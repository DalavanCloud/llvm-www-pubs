<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
In this paper, we propose a novel technique to detect all
dangling pointer uses at run-time that is efficient enough
for production use in server codes. One idea (previously
used by Electric Fence, PageHeap) is to use a new virtual
page for each allocation of the program and rely on page
protection mechanisms to check dangling pointer accesses.
This naive approach has two limitations that makes it im-
practical to use in production software: increased physical
memory usage and increased address space usage. We pro-
pose two key improvements that alleviate both these prob-
lems. First, we use a new virtual page for each allocation
of the program but map it to the same physical page as the
original allocator. This allows using nearly identical physi-
cal memory as the original program while still retaining the
dangling pointer detection capability. We also show how to
implement this idea without requiring any changes to the
underlying memory allocator. Our second idea alleviates
the problem of virtual address space exhaustion by using
a previously developed compiler transformation called Au-
tomatic Pool Allocation to reuse many virtual pages. The
transformation partitions the memory of the program based
on their lifetimes and allows us to reuse virtual pages when
portions of memory become inaccessible. Experimentally
we find that the run-time overhead for five unix servers is
less than 4%, for other unix utilities less than 15%. How-
ever, in case of allocation intensive benchmarks, we find our
overheads are much worse (up to 11x slowdown).
