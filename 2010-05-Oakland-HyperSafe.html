<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Virtualization is being widely adopted in today’s 
computing systems. Its unique security advantages in isolating 
and introspecting commodity OSes as virtual machines (VMs) 
have enabled a wide spectrum of applications. However, a com- 
mon, fundamental assumption is the presence of a trustworthy 
hypervisor. Unfortunately, the large code base of commodity 
hypervisors and recent successful hypervisor attacks (e.g., VM 
escape) seriously question the validity of this assumption. 
In this paper, we present HyperSafe, a lightweight approach 
that endows existing Type-I bare-metal hypervisors with a 
unique self-protection capability to provide lifetime control- 
ﬂow integrity. Speciﬁcally, we propose two key techniques. The 
ﬁrst one – non-bypassable memory lockdown – reliably protects 
the hypervisor’s code and static data from being compromised 
even in the presence of exploitable memory corruption bugs 
(e.g., buffer overﬂows), therefore successfully providing hyper- 
visor code integrity. The second one – restricted pointer indexing 
– introduces one layer of indirection to convert the control data 
into pointer indexes. These pointer indexes are restricted such 
that the corresponding call/return targets strictly follow the 
hypervisor control ﬂow graph, hence expanding protection to 
control-ﬂow integrity. We have built a prototype and used it to 
protect two open-source Type-I hypervisors: BitVisor and Xen. 
The experimental results with synthetic hypervisor exploits 
and benchmarking programs show HyperSafe can reliably 
enable the hypervisor self-protection and provide the integrity 
guarantee with a small performance overhead.
