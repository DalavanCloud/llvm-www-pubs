<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
We present ongoing work and first results in static and detailed quantitative runtime analysis of LLVM byte code for the purpose of automatic procedural level partitioning and co-synthesis of complex software systems. Runtime behaviour is captured by reverse compilation of LLVM bytecode into augmented, self-profiling ANSI-C simulator programs retaining the LLVM instruction level. The actual global data flow is captured both in quantity and value range to guide function unit layout in the synthesis of application specific processors. Currently the implemented tool LLILA (Low Level Intermediate Language Analyzer) focuses on static code analysis on the inter-procedural data flow via e.g. function parameters and global variables to uncover a program's potential paths of data exchange.
