<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Temporal memory safety errors, such as dangling pointer dereferences and double
frees, are a prevalent source of software bugs in unmanaged languages such as
C. Existing schemes that attempt to retrofit temporal safety for such languages
have high runtime overheads and/or are incomplete, thereby limiting their
effectiveness as debugging aids. This paper presents CETS, a compile-time
transformation for detecting all violations of temporal safety in C programs.
Inspired by existing approaches, CETS maintains a unique identifier with each
object, associates this metadata with the pointers in a disjoint metadata space
to retain memory layout compatibility, and checks that the object is still
allocated on pointer dereferences. A formal proof shows that this is sufficient
to provide temporal safety even in the presence of arbitrary casts if the
program contains no spatial safety violations. Our CETS prototype employs both
temporal check removal optimizations and traditional compiler optimizations to
achieve a runtime overhead of just 48% on average. When combined with a
spatial-checking system, the average overall overhead is 116% for complete
memory safety.
