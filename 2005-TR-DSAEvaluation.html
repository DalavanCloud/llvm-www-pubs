<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
This report describes a set of experiments to evaluate qualitatively the
effectiveness of <b>Data Structure Analysis (DSA)</b> in identifying properties of a
program's data structures. We manually inspected several benchmarks to
identify linked data structures and their properties, and compared these
against the results produced by DSA.  The properties we considered are those
that were the primary goals of DSA:
distinguishing different <i>kinds</i> of data structures,
distinct <i>instances</i> of a particular kind,
<i>type</i> information for objects within an LDS,
and information about the <i>lifetime</i> of such objects (particularly, those
local to a function rather than global). 
We define a set of metrics for the DS graphs computed by DSA that we use to
summarize our results concisely for each benchmark.
The results of the study are summarized in the last section.
