<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Providing high performance for pointer-intensive programs on modern
architectures is an increasingly difficult problem for compilers.
Pointer-intensive programs are often bound by memory latency and cache
performance, but traditional approaches to these problems usually fail:
Pointer-intensive programs are often highly-irregular and the compiler has
little control over the layout of heap allocated objects.</p>

<p>This thesis presents a new class of techniques named ``Macroscopic Data
Structure Analyses and Optimizations'', which is a new approach to the problem
of analyzing and optimizing pointer-intensive programs.  Instead of analyzing
individual load/store operations or structure definitions, this approach
identifies, analyzes, and transforms entire memory structures as a unit.  The
foundation of the approach is an analysis named Data Structure Analysis and a
transformation named Automatic Pool Allocation.  Data Structure Analysis is a
context-sensitive pointer analysis which identifies data structures on the heap
and their important properties (such as type safety).  Automatic Pool Allocation
uses the results of Data Structure Analysis to segregate dynamically allocated
objects on the heap, giving control over the layout of the data structure in
memory to the compiler.</p>

<p>Based on these two foundation techniques, this thesis describes several
performance improving optimizations for pointer-intensive programs.  First,
Automatic Pool Allocation itself provides important locality improvements for
the program.  Once the program is pool allocated, several pool-specific
optimizations can be performed to reduce inter-object padding and pool overhead.
Second, we describe an aggressive technique, Automatic Pointer Compression,
which reduces the size of pointers on 64-bit targets to 32-bits or less,
increasing effective cache capacity and memory bandwidth for pointer-intensive
programs.</p>

<p>This thesis describes the approach, analysis, and transformation of programs
with macroscopic techniques, and evaluates the net performance impact of the
transformations.  Finally, it describes a large class of potential applications
for the work in fields such as heap safety and reliability, program
understanding, distributed computing, and static garbage collection.</p>

<p>The "book form" is useful if you plan to print this out.  Print the file out
double sided, fold it in half, and staple it in the middle of the page.  It
dramatically reduces the number of pages of paper used.</p>
