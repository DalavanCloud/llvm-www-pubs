<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
64-bit address spaces are increasingly important for modern
applications, but they come at a price: pointers use twice
as much memory, reducing the effective cache capacity and memory
bandwidth of the system (compared to 32-bit address spaces). This paper 
presents a sophisticated,
automatic transformation that shrinks pointers from 64-bits
to 32-bits (and potentially less).  The approach is macroscopic, i.e., it
operates on an entire logical data structure in the program at a time.  It
allows an <i>individual</i> data structure instance or even a subset thereof
to grow up to 2<sup>32</sup> bytes in size.  Furthermore, the transformation can
choose to compress some data structures in a program but not others (e.g. if
only part of the program is type-safe).  We also describe (but have not
implemented) a dynamic version of the technique that can transparently expand
the pointers in an individual data structure if it exceeds the 4GB limit.
For a collection of pointer-intensive benchmarks, we show that the
transformation improves performance substantially (20% to 2x) for several of
these benchmarks, and also reduces peak heap size by a similar factor.
