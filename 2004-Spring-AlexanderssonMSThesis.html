<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>Dynamic programming languages are not generally precompiled, but are interpreted at run-time. This approach has some serious drawbacks, e.g. complex deployment, human readable source code not preserving the intellectual properties of the developers and no ability to do optimizations at compile-time or run-time.</p>

<p>In this paper we study the possibility to precompile the Ruby language, a dynamic object-oriented language, into Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) code for execution by the LLVM run-time, a compiler framework for lifelong optimization of an application. The result of the project is a Ruby compiler prototype, describing the infrastructure and overall design principles to map the highly dynamic properties of the Ruby language into low-level static constructs of the LLVM language.</p>

<p>The LLVM framework supports different hardware platforms, and by using LLVM
as the target of compilation the benefits of that portability are gained.</p>
