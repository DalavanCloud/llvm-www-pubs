<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Just-in-time compilers are invoked during application 
execution and therefore need to ensure fast compilation 
times. Consequently, runtime compiler designers are averse 
to implementing compile-time intensive optimization algorithms. Instead, they tend to select faster but less effective 
transformations. In this paper, we explore this trade-off for 
an important optimization â global register allocation. We 
present a graph-coloring register allocator that has been 
redesigned for runtime compilation. Compared to Chaitin-Briggs [7], a standard graph-coloring technique, the reformulated algorithm requires considerably less allocation 
time and produces allocations that are only marginally 
worse than those of Chaitin-Briggs. Our experimental results indicate that the allocator performs better than the 
linear-scan and Chaitin-Briggs allocators on most benchmarks in a runtime compilation environment. By increasing 
allocation efficiency and preserving optimization quality, 
the presented algorithm increases the suitability and profitability of a graph-coloring register allocation strategy for 
a runtime compiler.
