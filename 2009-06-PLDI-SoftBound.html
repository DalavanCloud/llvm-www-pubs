<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
The serious bugs and security vulnerabilities facilitated by C/C++'s
lack of bounds checking are well known, yet C and C++ remain in
widespread use.  Unfortunately, C's arbitrary pointer arithmetic,
conflation of pointers and arrays, and programmer-visible memory layout
make retrofitting C/C++ with spatial safety guarantees extremely
challenging.  Existing approaches suffer from incompleteness, have high
runtime overhead, or require non-trivial changes to the C source code.
Thus far, these deficiencies have prevented widespread adoption of such
techniques.

This paper proposes SoftBound, a compile-time transformation for
enforcing spatial safety of C.  Inspired by HardBound, a
previously proposed hardware-assisted approach, SoftBound similarly
records base and bound information for every pointer as disjoint
metadata.  This decoupling enables SoftBound to provide
spatial safety without requiring changes to C source code.  Unlike
HardBound, SoftBound is a software-only approach and performs
metadata manipulation only when loading or storing pointer values.  A
formal proof shows that this is sufficient to provide spatial safety
even in the presence of arbitrary casts.  SoftBound's full checking
mode provides complete spatial violation detection with 67%
runtime overhead on average.  To further reduce overheads, SoftBound has a store-only checking mode that successfully detects all the
security vulnerabilities in a test suite at the cost of only
21% runtime overhead on average.
