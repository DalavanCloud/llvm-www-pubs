<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
This thesis investigates compiler optimisations applied to a JIT-compiling emulator which is used in a videcoding system. The JIT compiler is built using LLVM which provides some readily available optimisation passes. Some of these are evaluated, some are patched, and some new ones are implemented. The optimisations are evaluated by running a number of benchmarks. By applying optimisations that target redundancies introduced by the JIT-compiler, as well as some optimisations not performed on the firmware originally, a benchmark execution speed-up of between 20 and 70% is achieved.
