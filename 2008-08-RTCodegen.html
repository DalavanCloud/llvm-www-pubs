<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
  Typical material systems are based on a collection of properties 
  that are set on a per-object or per-surface basis usually by
evaluation of a description file at run-time. Shading of hit points is then 
  implemented by interpreting these properties. In order to be able 
  to support a large feature set, different code paths need to be
created, e.g. for reflection and refraction effects. Conditions for the 
  branches associated with these fragments of functionality need to 
  be evaluated for each shaded ray, which may degrade performance 
  considerably. Material specific optimization opportunities are also 
  missed out by having a generic function for all material 
configurations.  We propose the use of run-time code generation for materials.
