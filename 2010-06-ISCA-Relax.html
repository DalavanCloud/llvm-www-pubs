<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
As technology scales ever further, device unreliability is creating excessive
complexity for hardware to maintain the illusion of perfect operation. In this
paper, we consider whether exposing hardware fault information to software and
allowing software to control fault recovery simplifies hardware design and helps
technology scaling.</p>

<p>The combination of emerging applications and emerging many-core architectures
makes software recovery a viable alternative to hardware-based fault recovery.
Emerging applications tend to have few I/O and memory side-effects, which limits
the amount of information that needs checkpointing, and they allow discarding
individual sub-computations with small qualitative impact. Software recovery can
harness these properties in ways that hardware recovery cannot.</p>

<p>
We describe Relax, an architectural framework for software recovery of hardware
faults. Relax includes three core components: (1) an ISA extension that allows
software to mark regions of code for software recovery, (2) a hardware
organization that simplifies reliability considerations and provides energy
efficiency with hardware recovery support removed, and (3) software support for
compilers and programmers to utilize the Relax ISA. Applying Relax to counter
the effects of process variation, our results show a 20% energy efficiency
improvement for PARSEC applications with only minimal source code changes and
simpler hardware.
