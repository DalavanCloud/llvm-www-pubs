<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
With the availability of chip multiprocessor (CMP) and simultaneous
multithreading (SMT) machines, extracting thread level parallelism from a
sequential program has become crucial for improving performance. However, many
sequential programs cannot be easily parallelized due to the presence of
dependences. To solve this problem, different solutions have been proposed. Some
of them make the optimistic assumption that such dependences rarely manifest
themselves at runtime. However, when this assumption is violated, the recovery
causes very large overhead. Other approaches incur large synchronization or
computation overhead when resolving the dependences. Consequently, for a loop
with frequently arising cross-iteration dependences, previous techniques are not
able to speed up the execution. In this paper we propose a compiler technique
which uses state separation and multiple value prediction to speculatively
parallelize loops in sequential programs that contain frequently arising
cross-iteration dependences. The key idea is to generate multiple versions of a
loop iteration based on multiple predictions of values of variables involved in
cross-iteration dependences (i.e., live-in variables). These speculative
versions and the preceding loop iteration are executed in separate memory states
simultaneously. After the execution, if one of these versions is correct (i.e.,
its predicted values are found to be correct), then we merge its state and the
state of the preceding iteration because the dependence between the two
iterations is correctly resolved. The memory states of other incorrect versions
are completely discarded. Based on this idea, we further propose a runtime
adaptive scheme that not only gives a good performance but also achieves better
CPU utilization. We conducted experiments on 10 benchmark programs on a real
machine. The results show that our technique can achieve 1.7x speedup on average
across all used benchmarks.
