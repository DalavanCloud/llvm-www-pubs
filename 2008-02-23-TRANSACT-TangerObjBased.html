<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Current transactifying compilers for unmanaged environments (e.g., systems software written 
in C/C++) target only word-based software transactional memories (STMs) because the 
compiler cannot easily infer whether it is safe to transform a transactional access to a 
certain memory location in an object-based way. To use object-based STMs in these 
environments, programmers must use explicit calls to the STM or use a restricted language 
dialect, both of which are not practical. In this paper, we show how an existing pointer 
analysis can be used to let a transactifying compiler for C/C++ use object-based accesses 
whenever this is possible and safe, while falling back to word-based accesses otherwise. 
Programmers do not need to provide any annotations and do not have to use a restricted 
language. Our evaluation also shows that an object-based STM can be significantly faster 
than a word-based STM with an otherwise identical design and implementation, even if the 
parameters of the latter have been tuned.
