<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Traditionally, the verification effort is applied to the abstract
algorithmic descriptions of the underlining software. However, even
well understood protocols such as Petersonâ€™s protocol for mutual
exclusion, whose algorithmic description takes only half a page, have
published implementations that are erroneous. Furthermore, the
semantics of the implementations can be altered by optimizing
compilers, which are very large applications and, consequently, are
bound to have bugs. Thus, it is highly desirable to ensure the
correctness of the compiled code especially in safety critical and
high-assurance software. This dissertation describes two alternative
approaches that bring us closer to solving the problem.</p>

<p>First, we present Compiler Validation via Analysis of the
Cross-Product (CoVaC) - a deductive framework for proving program
equivalence and its application to automatic verification of
transformations performed by optimizing compilers. To leverage the
existing program analysis techniques, we reduce the equivalence
checking problem to analysis of one system - a cross-product of the
two input programs. We show how the approach can be effectively used
for checking equivalence of single-threaded programs that are
structurally similar. Unlike the existing frameworks, our approach
accommodates absence of compiler annotations and handles most of the
classical intraprocedural optimizations such as constant folding,
reassociation, common subexpression elimination, code motion, branch
optimizations, and others. In addition, we have developed rules for
translation validation of interprocedural optimizations, which can be
applied when compiler annotations are available.</p>

<p>
The second contribution is the pancam framework for model checking
multi-threaded C programs. pancam first compiles a multi-threaded C
program into  optimized bytecode format. The framework relies on Spin,
an existing explicit state model checker, to orchestrate the program's
state space search. However, the program transitions and states are
computed by the pancam bytecode interpreter. A feature of our approach
is that not only pancam checks the actual implementation, but it can
also check the code after compiler optimizations. Pancam addresses the
state space explosion problem by allowing users to define data
abstraction functions and to constrain the number of allowed context
switches. We also describe a partial order reduction method that
reduces context switches using dynamic knowledge computed on-the-fly,
while being sound for both safety and liveness properties.
