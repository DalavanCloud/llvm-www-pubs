<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
This document introduces the LLVM compiler infrastructure and instruction set, a
simple approach that enables sophisticated code transformations at link time,
runtime, and in the field.  It is a pragmatic approach to compilation,
interfering with programmers and tools as little as possible, while still
retaining extensive high-level information from source-level compilers for later
stages of an application's lifetime.  We describe the LLVM instruction set,
the design of the LLVM system, and some of its key components.

<h2>Update:</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Since this document was published, one <b>significant</b> change has been
    made to LLVM: the GCC C front-end described in the document has been
    completely rewritten from scratch.  The new C front-end is based on the
    mainline GCC CVS tree (what will become GCC 3.4), and expands type-safe LLVM
    code from the GCC AST representation, instead of from the untyped GCC RTL
    representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    This change dramatically improved the quality of code generated and the
    stability of the system as a whole.
