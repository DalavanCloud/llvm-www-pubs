<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Modern software development practices lack portable, precise and powerful
mechanisms for describing performance properties of application code.
Traditional approaches rely almost solely on performance instrumentation
libraries, which have significant drawbacks in certain types (e.g., adaptive) of
applications, present the end user with integration challenges and complex APIs,
and often pose portability problems of their own.  This thesis proposes a small
set of C-like language extensions that facilitate the treatment of performance
properties as intrinsic properties of application code.  The proposed language
extensions allow the application developer to encode performance expectations,
gather and aggregate various types of performance information, and more, all at
the language level.  Furthermore, this thesis demonstrates many novel compiler
implementation techniques that make the the presented approach possible with an
arbitrary (third-party) compiler, and that minimize performance perturbation by
enabling compiler optimizations that are commonly inhibited by traditional
approaches.  This thesis describes the fundamental contribution of
language-level performance properties, the language extensions themselves, the
implementation of the compilation and runtime system, together with a standard
library of widely-used metrics, and demonstrates the role that the extensions
and compilation system can play in describing the performance-oriented aspects
of both a production-quality raytracing application and a long-running adaptive
server code.
