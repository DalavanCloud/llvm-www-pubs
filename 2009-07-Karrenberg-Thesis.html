<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Modern processor architectures provide the possibility to execute an instruction
on multiple values at once. So-called SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple
Data) instructions work on <i>packets</i> (or <i>vectors</i>) of data instead
of scalar values. They offer a significant performance boost for data-parallel
algorithms that perform the same operations on large amounts of data, e.g. data
encoding and decoding, image processing, or ray tracing.
However, the performance gain comes at a price: programming languages
provide no elegant means to exploit SIMD instruction sets. Packet operations
have to be coded by hand, which is complicated, unintuitive, and error prone.
Thus, <i>packetization</i>&#8212;the transformation of scalar code to packet
form&#8212;is mostly applied automatically by local compiler optimizations
(e.g. during loop vectorization) or with a lot of manual effort at
performance-critical parts of a system.
<p>
This thesis describes an algorithm for <i>automatic packetization</i> that
allows a programmer to write <i>scalar</i> functions but use them on
<i>packets</i> of data. A compiler pass automatically transforms those
functions to work on packets of the target-architecture's SIMD width. The
resulting packetized function computes the same results as multiple executions
of the scalar code.
<p>
The algorithm is implemented in a source-language and target-architecture
independent intermediate representation (the <i>Low Level Virtual Machine
(LLVM)</i>), which enables its use in many different environments.
<p>
The performance of the generated code is shown in a real-world case
study in the context of real-time ray tracing: serial shader code written in
C++ is automatically specialized, optimized, and packetized at runtime. The
packetized shaders outperform their scalar counterparts by an average factor
of 3.6 on a standard SSE architecture of SIMD width 4.
