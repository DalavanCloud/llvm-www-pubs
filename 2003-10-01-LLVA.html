<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
A virtual instruction set architecture (V-ISA) implemented via a
processor-specific software translation layer can provide great flexibility to
processor designers.  Recent examples such as Crusoe and DAISY, however, have
used existing hardware instruction sets as virtual ISAs, which complicates
translation and optimization. In fact, there has been little research on
specific designs for a virtual ISA for processors.  This paper proposes a novel
virtual ISA (LLVA) and a translation strategy for implementing it on arbitrary
hardware.  The instruction set is typed, uses an infinite virtual register set
in Static Single Assignment form, and provides explicit control-flow and
dataflow information, and yet uses low-level operations closely matched to
traditional hardware.  It includes novel mechanisms to allow more flexible
optimization of native code, including a flexible exception model and minor
constraints on self-modifying code.  We propose a translation strategy that
enables offline translation and transparent offline caching of native code and
profile information, while remaining completely OS-independent.  It also
supports optimizations directly on the representation at install-time, runtime,
and offline between executions.  We show experimentally that the virtual ISA is
compact, it is closely matched to ordinary hardware instruction sets, and
permits very fast code generation, yet has enough high-level information to
permit sophisticated program analyses and optimizations.
