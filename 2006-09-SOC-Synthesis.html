<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
With the rapid increase of complexity in System-on-a-Chip (SoC) design,
the electronic design automation (EDA) 
community is moving from RTL (Register Transfer Level) 
synthesis to behavioral-level and system-level synthesis. The 
needs of system-level verification and software/hardware co- 
design also prefer behavior-level executable specifications, such 
as C or SystemC. In this paper we present the platform-based 
synthesis system, named xPilot, being developed at UCLA. The 
first objective of xPilot is to provide novel behavioral synthesis 
capability for automatically generating efficient RTL code from 
a C or SystemC description for a given system platform and 
optimizing the logic, interconnects, performance, and power 
simultaneously. The second objective of xPilot is to provide a 
platform-based system-level synthesis capability, including both 
synthesis for application-specific configurable processors and 
heterogeneous multi-core systems. Preliminary experiments on 
FPGAs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a wide range 
of applications and its value in exploring various design tradeoffs.
