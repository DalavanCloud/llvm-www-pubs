<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
This thesis details the implementation of Swing Modulo Scheduling, a
Software Pipelining technique, that is both effective and efficient in
terms of compile time and generated code. Software Pipelining aims to
expose Instruction Level Parallelism in loops which tend to help
scientific and graphical applications.</p>

<p>Modulo Scheduling is a category of algorithms that attempt to overlap
iterations of single basic block loops and schedule instructions based
upon a priority (derived from a set of heuristics). The approach used
by Swing Modulo Scheduling is designed to achieve a highly optimized
schedule, keeping register pressure low, and does both in a reasonable
amount of compile time.</p>

<p>One drawback of Swing Modulo Scheduling, (and all Modulo Scheduling
algorithms) is that they are missing opportunities for further
Instruction Level Parallelism by only handling single basic block
loops. This thesis details extensions to the Swing Modulo Scheduling
algorithm to handle multiple basic block loops in the form of a
superblock. A superblock is group of basic blocks that have a single
entry and multiple exits. Extending Swing Modulo Scheduling to support
these types of loops increases the number of loops Swing Modulo
Scheduling can be applied to.  In addition, it allows Modulo
Scheduling to be performed on hot paths (also single entry, multiple
exit), found with profile information to be optimized later offline or
at runtime.</p>

<p>Our implementation of Swing Modulo Scheduling and extensions to the
algorithm for superblock loops were evaluated and found to be both
effective and efficient. For the original algorithm, benchmarks were
transformed to have performance gains of 10-33%, while the extended
algorithm increased benchmark performance from 7-22%. </p>

<p>
   The "book form" is useful if you plan to print this out.  Print the file out
   double sided, fold it in half, and staple it in the middle of the page.  It
   dramatically reduces the number of pages of paper used.
