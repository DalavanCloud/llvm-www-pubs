<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>Current implementations of software providing dynamic aspect functionality in operating system (OS) kernels are quite 
restricted in the possible joinpoint types for native code they 
are able to support. Most of the pro jects implementing advice for native code use basic technologies adopted from instrumentation methods which allow to provide before, after 
and around joinpoints for functions. More elaborate join-points, however, are not available since support for monitoring native code execution in current CPUs is very restricted 
without extensive extensions of the compiler toolchain. To 
realize improved ways of aspect activation in OS kernels, we 
present an architecture that provides an efficient low-level 
virtual machine running on top of a microkernel system in 
cooperation with an aspect deployment service to provide 
novel ways of aspect activation in kernel environments.
