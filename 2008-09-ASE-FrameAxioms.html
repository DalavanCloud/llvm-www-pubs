<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>

Many approaches to software verification are currently 
semi-automatic: a human must provide key logical insights 
— e.g., loop invariants, class invariants, and frame axioms 
that limit the scope of changes that must be analyzed. 
This paper describes a technique for automatically inferring frame 
axioms of procedures and loops using static 
analysis. The technique builds on a pointer analysis 
that generates limited information about all data structures 
in the heap. Our technique uses that information 
to over-approximate a potentially unbounded set of memory 
locations modified by each procedure/loop; this over-approximation 
is a candidate frame axiom. 
We have tested this approach on the buffer-overﬂow 
benchmarks from ASE 2007. With manually provided specifications 
and invariants/axioms, our tool could verify/falsify 
226 of the 289 benchmarks. With our automatically inferred 
frame axioms, the tool could verify/falsify 203 of the 289, 
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
