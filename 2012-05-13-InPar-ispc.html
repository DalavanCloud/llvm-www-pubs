<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
SIMD parallelism has become an increasingly important mechanism for delivering
performance in modern CPUs, due its power efficiency and relatively low cost in
die area compared to other forms of parallelism. Unfortunately, languages and
compilers for CPUs have not kept up with the hardware's capabilities.  Existing
CPU parallel programming models focus primarily on multi-core parallelism,
neglecting the substantial computational capabilities that are available in CPU
SIMD vector units. GPU-oriented languages like OpenCL support SIMD but lack
capabilities needed to achieve maximum efficiency on CPUs and suffer from
GPU-driven constraints that impair ease of use on CPUs.
</p>

<p>
We have developed a compiler, the Intel SPMD Program Compiler (ispc), that
delivers very high performance on CPUs thanks to effective use of both multiple
processor cores and SIMD vector units.  ispc draws from GPU programming
languages, which have 
shown that for many applications the easiest way to program SIMD units is to
use a single-program, multiple-data (SPMD) model, with each instance of the
program mapped to one SIMD lane.  We discuss language features that make ispc
easy to adopt and use productively with existing software systems and show that
ispc delivers up to 35x speedups on a 4-core system and up to 240x speedups on
a 40-core system for complex workloads (compared to serial C++ code).
