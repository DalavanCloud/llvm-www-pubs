<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Targeting the operating system (OS) kernel, kernel rootkits pose a formidable
threat to computer systems and their users. Recent efforts have made
significant progress in blocking them from injecting malicious code into the OS
kernel for execution. Unfortunately, they cannot block the emerging so-called
return-oriented rootkits (RORs). Without the need of injecting their own
malicious code, these rootkits can discover and chain together "return-oriented
gadgets" (that consist of only legitimate kernel code) for rootkit computation.
</p>

<p>
In this paper, we propose a compiler-based approach to defeat these
return-oriented rootkits. Our approach recognizes the hallmark of
return-oriented rootkits, i.e., the ret instruction, and accordingly aims to
completely remove them in a running OS kernel. Specifically, one key technique
named return indirection is to replace the return address in a stack frame into
a return index and disallow a ROR from using their own return addresses to
locate and assemble return-oriented gadgets. Further, to prevent legitimate
instructions that happen to contain return opcodes from being misused,we also
propose two other techniques, register allocation and peephole optimization, to
avoid introducing them in the first place. We have developed a LLVM-based
prototype and used it to generate a return-less FreeBSD kernel. Our evaluation
results indicate that the proposed approach is generic, effective, and can be
implemented on commodity hardware with a low performance overhead.
