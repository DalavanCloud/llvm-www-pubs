<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Debugging real systems is hard, requires deep knowledge of the code, and is time-consuming. Bug reports rarely provide sufficient information, thus forcing developers to turn into detectives searching for an explanation of how the program could have arrived at the reported failure point.</p>

<p>Execution synthesis is a technique for automating this detective work: given a program and a bug report, it automatically produces an execution of the program that leads to the reported bug symptoms. Using a combination of static analysis and symbolic execution, it “synthesizes” a thread schedule and various required program inputs that cause the bug to manifest. The synthesized execution can be played back deterministically in a regular debugger, like gdb. This is particularly useful in debugging concurrency bugs.</p>

<p>Our technique requires no runtime tracing or program modifications, thus incurring no runtime overhead and being practical for use in production systems. We evaluate ESD, a debugger based on execution synthesis on popular software (e.g., the SQLite database, ghttpd Web server, HawkNL network library, UNIX utilities): starting from mere bug reports, ESD reproduces on its own several real concurrency and memory safety bugs in less than three minutes.</p>
