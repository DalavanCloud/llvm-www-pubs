<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>The Master/Slave Speculative Parallelization paradigm relies on the use of a highly optimized
and mostly correct version of a sequential program, called distilled code, for breaking inter-task
dependences. We describe the design and implementation of an optimization framework that can
create such distilled code within the context of an MSSP simulator. Our optimizer processes pieces
of Alpha machine code called traces and is designed to optimize code while adhering to certain
restrictions and requirements imposed by the MSSP paradigm. We describe the specific places
where our optimizer is different from that in a compiler and explain how the optimized traces are
deployed in the simulator.</p>
