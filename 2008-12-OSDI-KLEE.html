<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
We present a new symbolic execution tool, KLEE, capable of automatically 
generating tests that achieve high coverage on a diverse set of complex and 
environmentally-intensive programs. We used KLEE to thoroughly check all 
89 stand-alone programs in the GNU COREUTILS utility suite, which form the core 
user-level environment installed on millions of Unix systems, and arguably 
are the single most heavily tested set of open-source programs in 
existence. KLEE-generated tests achieve high line coverage — on average over 90% 
per tool (median: over 94%) — and significantly beat the coverage of the 
developers' own hand-written test suites. When we did the same for 75 
equivalent tools in the BUSYBOX embedded system suite, results were even 
better, including 100% coverage on 31 of them. 
We also used KLEE as a bug finding tool, applying it to 452 applications (over 
430K total lines of code), where it found 56 serious bugs, including 
three in COREUTILS that had been missed for over 15 years. Finally, we 
used KLEE to cross-check purportedly identical BUSY-BOX and COREUTILS utilities, 
finding functional correctness errors and a myriad of inconsistencies.
