<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Modern programming languages and software engineering principles are causing
increasing problems for compiler systems.  Traditional approaches, which use 
a simple compile-link-execute model, are unable to provide adequate application
performance under the demands of the new conditions.  Traditional approaches to
interprocedural and profile-driven compilation can provide the application
performance needed, but require infeasible amounts of compilation time to build
the application.</p>

<p>
This thesis presents LLVM, a design and implementation of a compiler 
infrastructure which supports a unique <i>multi-stage</i> optimization system.
This system is designed to support extensive interprocedural and 
profile-driven optimizations, while being efficient enough for use in
commercial compiler systems.</p>

<p>
The LLVM virtual instruction set is the glue that holds the system together.  It
is a low-level representation, but with <i>high-level type information</i>.
This provides the benefits of a low-level representation (compact
representation, wide variety of available transformations, etc.) as well as
providing high-level information to support aggressive interprocedural
optimizations at link- and post-link time.  In particular, this system is
designed to support optimization in the field, both at run-time and during
otherwise unused idle time on the machine.</p>

<p>
This thesis also describes an implementation of this compiler design, the LLVM 
compiler infrastructure, proving that the design is feasible.  The LLVM
compiler infrastructure is a maturing and efficient system, which we show is a 
good host for a variety of research.  More information about LLVM can be found
on its web site at: <a

<p>
   The "book form" is useful if you plan to print this out.  Print the file out
   double sided, fold it in half, and staple it in the middle of the page.  It
   dramatically reduces the number of pages of paper used.
